If you would like the bot to work, you will need to
replace the "token" field in "config.json" with your
bot's token. I have omitted the "config.json" file
for security reasons concerning the token. The
"config.json" is described by the following: <br />
<br />
{ <br />
    "prefix": "~",<br />
    "token": "INSERT TOKEN HERE" <br />
} <br />
