# Update Log: September 2020

**TL;DR:** Work with my professor at NVSL picked up this month, and school is starting soon, so progress of the bot was a lot slower for September. For September, I aimed to add one new command every week. Since there is not as much to update, and will likely not be much to update now that school has started again, I've decided to make these Update Logs monthly instead of weekly.


## New Feature

## `~mastery`: Player champion mastery lookup

The `~mastery` command displays the specified player's top 10 highest mastery champions. It includes the following information:
 * Champion
 * Mastery level
 * Total mastery points
 * Time since champion was last played

## `~rotation`: Free champion rotation lookup
The `~rotation` command displays the current free champion rotation for the specified region (defaults to `NA` if none is specified). Includes a separate section for free champions only for new players.

## `~champion`: Champion information lookup
The `~mastery` command displays the following information about the specified champion:
 * Lore blurb
 * Base stats
 * Stats growth per level
 * Skill names

## `~skill`: Champion skill lookup
The `~mastery` command displays the following information about the specified champion's skill:
